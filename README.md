# Discord AI Companion

Nova is a friendly, slightly witty Discord companion that chats naturally in DMs or when mentioned in servers. It runs on Node.js, uses `discord.js` v14, and supports OpenRouter (recommended) or OpenAI backends for model access, plus lightweight local memory for persistent personality.

## Features
- Conversational replies in DMs automatically; replies in servers when mentioned or in a pinned channel.
- Chat model (defaults to `meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct` when using OpenRouter) for dialogue and a low-cost embedding model (`nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` by default). OpenAI keys/models may be used as a fallback.
- Short-term, long-term, and summarized memory layers with cosine-similarity retrieval.
- Automatic memory pruning, importance scoring, and transcript summarization when chats grow long.
- Local SQLite memory file (no extra infrastructure) powered by `sql.js`, plus graceful retries for the model API (OpenRouter/OpenAI).
- Optional "miss u" pings that DM your coder at random intervals (0–6h) when `CODER_USER_ID` is set.
- Dynamic per-message prompt directives that tune Nova's tone (empathetic, hype, roleplay, etc.) before every OpenAI call.
- Lightweight Google scraping for fresh answers without paid APIs (locally cached).
- Guard rails that refuse "ignore previous instructions"-style jailbreak attempts plus a configurable search blacklist.
- The same blacklist applies to everyday conversation—if a user message contains a banned term, Nova declines the topic outright.

      npm install
      ```
   2. Copy the environment template:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
   3. Fill `.env` with your secrets:
      - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord bot token
      - `USE_OPENROUTER`: Set to `true` to route requests through OpenRouter (recommended).
      - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter API key (when `USE_OPENROUTER=true`).
      - `OPENROUTER_MODEL`: Optional chat model override for OpenRouter (default `meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct`).
      - `OPENROUTER_EMBED_MODEL`: Optional embed model override for OpenRouter (default `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2`).
      - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Optional OpenAI key (used as fallback when `USE_OPENROUTER` is not `true`).
      - `BOT_CHANNEL_ID`: Optional guild channel ID where the bot can reply without mentions
      - `CODER_USER_ID`: Optional Discord user ID to receive surprise DMs every 6–8 hours (configurable)
      - `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH`: Set to `false` to disable Google lookups (default `true`)
      - `CONTINUATION_INTERVAL_MS`: (optional) ms between proactive follow-ups (default 15000)
      - `CONTINUATION_MAX_PROACTIVE`: (optional) max number of proactive follow-ups (default 10)
      - `CODER_PING_MIN_MS` / `CODER_PING_MAX_MS`: (optional) override min/max coder ping window in ms (defaults 6–8 hours)

   ## Running
   - Development: `npm run dev`
   - Production: `npm start`

   ### Optional PM2 Setup
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name nova-bot -- run start
   pm2 save
   ```
   PM2 restarts the bot if it crashes and keeps logs (`pm2 logs nova-bot`).

   - **Short-term (recency buffer):** Last 10 conversation turns kept verbatim for style and continuity. Stored per user inside `data/memory.sqlite`.
   - **Long-term (vector store):** Every user message + bot reply pair becomes an embedding via `text-embedding-3-small`. Embeddings, raw text, timestamps, and heuristic importance scores live in the same SQLite file. Retrieval uses cosine similarity plus a small importance boost; top 5 results feed the prompt.
   - **Summary layer:** When the recency buffer grows past ~3000 characters, Nova asks OpenAI to condense the transcript to <120 words, keeps the summary, and trims the raw buffer down to the last few turns. This keeps token usage low while retaining story arcs.
   - **Importance scoring:** Messages mentioning intent words ("plan", "remember", etc.), showing length, or emotional weight receive higher scores. When the store exceeds its cap, the lowest-importance/oldest memories are pruned. You can also call `pruneLowImportanceMemories()` manually if needed.

   - **Embedding math:** `text-embedding-3-small` returns 1,536 floating-point numbers for each text chunk. That giant array is a vector map of the message’s meaning; similar moments land near each other in 1,536-dimensional space.
   - **What gets embedded:** After every user→bot turn, `recordInteraction()` (see [src/memory.js](src/memory.js)) bundles the pair, scores its importance, asks OpenAI for an embedding, and stores `{ content, embedding, importance, timestamp }` inside the SQLite tables.
   - **Why so many numbers:** Cosine similarity needs raw vectors to compare new thoughts to past ones. When a fresh message arrives, `retrieveRelevantMemories()` embeds it too, calculates cosine similarity against every stored vector, adds a small importance boost, and returns the top five memories to inject into the system prompt.
   - **Self-cleaning:** If the DB grows past the configured limits, low-importance items are trimmed, summaries compress the short-term transcript, and you can delete `data/memory.sqlite` to reset everything cleanly.

   ### Migrating legacy `memory.json`
   - Keep your original `data/memory.json` in place and delete/rename `data/memory.sqlite` before launching the bot.
   - On the next start, the new SQL engine auto-imports every user record from the JSON file, logs a migration message, and writes the populated `.sqlite` file.
   - After confirming the data landed, archive or remove the JSON backup if you no longer need it.

   ## Conversation Flow
   1. Incoming message triggers only if it is a DM, mentions the bot, or appears in the configured channel.
   2. The user turn is appended to short-term memory immediately.
   3. The memory engine retrieves relevant long-term memories and summary text.
   4. A compact system prompt injects personality, summary, and relevant memories before passing short-term history to the model API (OpenRouter/OpenAI).
   5. The reply is sent back to Discord. If Nova wants to send a burst of thoughts, she emits the `<SPLIT>` token and the runtime fans it out into multiple sequential Discord messages.
   6. Long chats automatically summarize; low-value memories eventually get pruned.

   Nova may also enter a proactive continuation mode after replying: if you stay quiet, she can send short, context-aware follow-ups at the configured interval until you stop her with a short phrase like "gotta go" or after the configured maximum number of follow-ups.

   ## Dynamic Prompting
   - Each turn, Nova inspects the fresh user message (tone, instructions, roleplay cues, explicit “split this” requests) plus the last few utterances.
   - A helper (`composeDynamicPrompt` in [src/bot.js](src/bot.js)) emits short directives like “User mood: fragile, be gentle” or “They asked for roleplay—stay in character.”
   - These directives slot into the system prompt ahead of memories, so OpenAI gets real-time guidance tailored to the latest vibe without losing the core persona.

   ## Local Web Search
   - `src/search.js` grabs the standard Google results page with a real browser user-agent, extracts the top titles/links/snippets, and caches them for 10 minutes to stay polite.
   - `bot.js` detects when a question sounds “live” (mentions today/news/google/etc.) and injects the formatted snippets into the prompt as "Live intel". No paid APIs involved—it’s just outbound HTTPS from your machine.
   - Toggle this via `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=false` if you don’t want Nova to look things up.
   - Edit `data/filter.txt` to maintain a newline-delimited list of banned keywords/phrases; matching queries are blocked before hitting Google *and* Nova refuses to discuss them in normal chat.
   - Every entry in `data/search.log` records which transport (direct or cache) served the lookup so you can audit traffic paths quickly.

   ## Proactive Pings
   - When `CODER_USER_ID` is provided, Nova spins up a timer on startup that waits a random duration between the configured min/max interval before DMing that user (defaults to 6–8 hours). Override the window with `CODER_PING_MIN_MS` and `CODER_PING_MAX_MS` in milliseconds.
   - Each ping goes through the configured model API (OpenRouter/OpenAI) with the prompt "you havent messaged your coder in a while, and you wanna chat with him!" so responses stay playful and unscripted.
   - The ping gets typed out (`sendTyping`) for realism and is stored back into the memory layers so the next incoming reply has context.

   - The bot retries OpenAI requests up to 3 times with incremental backoff when rate limited.
   - `data/memory.sqlite` is ignored by git but will grow with usage; back it up if you want persistent personality (and keep `data/memory.json` around only if you need legacy migrations).
   - To reset persona, delete `data/memory.sqlite` while the bot is offline.

   Happy chatting!
